						<h2>Meet Coach Lili</h2>
						<p>Hi, I'm Lili. I am a trauma-informed coach, an advocate, and the founder of Redemption Era. I created this space because I know what it feels like to carry emotional wounds in silence. After years of my own healing and growth, I built Redemption Era to offer the kind of honest, grounded support I once needed.</p>
						<p>I hold a Bachelor of Social Work, BSW, and a trauma informed coaching certification. I am not a licensed therapist. I provide trauma informed coaching and peer centered support.</p>

						<h1>Redemption Era - Terms of Service</h1>
						<p><strong>Last Updated: </strong>8/14/2025</p>

						<h2>1. Parties, Effective Date, and Scope</h2>
						<p><strong>1.1 Parties. </strong>These Terms of Service ("Terms") are between <strong>Redemption Era</strong> (the "Provider", "we", "us", or "our") and the individual client who accepts these Terms (the "Client" or "you"). <address>Provider Contact: Redemption Era, 3705 Terrace Ave., Pennsauken, NJ 08110, <a href="mailto:redemp.era2025@gmail.com">redemp.era2025@gmail.com</a></address></p>
						<p><strong>1.2 Effective Date. </strong>These Terms take effect on the date the Client signs or otherwise accepts them (the "Effective Date").</p>
						<p><strong>1.3 Scope of Services. </strong>The Provider will deliver coaching services described in the selected package (the "Services"). Coaching is non-clinical, supportive, and is <strong>not</strong> therapy, counseling, diagnosis, or a substitute for professional mental health care.</p>

						<h2>2. Definitions</h2>
						<p><strong>2.1 "Personal Data" </strong>means information that identifies or can reasonably identify an individual.</p>
						<p><strong>2.2 "Third-Party Platform" </strong>means any vendor or service used to deliver Services, including but not limited to Zoom, Google Meet, Discord, PayPal, and other scheduling/payment processors.</p>
						<p><strong>2.3 Other defined terms </strong>appear where first used.</p>

						<h2>3. Client Acknowledgements & Representations</h2>
						<p><strong>3.1 Non-Therapeutic Nature. </strong>The Client acknowledges coaching is not therapy and the Provider is not a licensed mental-health provider. If the Client needs emergency or clinical care, the Client will seek qualified help.</p>
						<p><strong>3.2 Voluntary Participation. </strong>Participation is voluntary. The Client may stop at any time. Completed sessions are non-refundable except as provided in Section 4 (Fees, Payment & Refunds).</p>
						<p><strong>3.3 Accurate Information. </strong>The Client will provide accurate intake information and will update the Provider if contact or other material information changes.</p>

						<h2>4. Fees, Payment, Refunds & Sliding Scale</h2>
						<p><strong>4.1 Fees and Payment. </strong>Fees are set out in the package selected at purchase. Payment is due in full before the first session unless a written payment plan exists. The Provider accepts PayPal and other payment methods published at checkout.</p>
						<p><strong>4.2 Refunds </strong>Except as required by applicable law, all sales are final. Sessions already delivered are non-refundable. For pre-paid packages, unused sessions will be handled under Section 5 (Cancellation & Rescheduling) and Section 8 (Package Expiration). The Provider may, in its sole discretion, issue credits or refunds for exceptional circumstances (e.g., the Provider cancels a session). Where applicable law provides a consumer right of withdrawal or refund (for example, a statutory cooling-off period), the Provider will comply.</p>
						<p><strong>4.3 Sliding Scale. </strong>Sliding-scale arrangements are discretionary, require written confirmation, and are subject to the agreed payment schedule.</p>

						<h2>5. Cancellation, Rescheduling, and No-Shows</h2>
						<p><strong>5.1 Standard Notice. </strong>The Client must provide at least 24 hours' notice to cancel or reschedule a session.</p>
						<p><strong>5.2 Grace Reschedule. </strong>One grace reschedule per package is allowed, subject to availability.</p>
						<p><strong>5.3 Late Arrival. </strong>Sessions begin and end at scheduled times. If the Client is more than 15 minutes late without prior notice, the session may be forfeited and treated as a no-show.</p>
						<p><strong>5.4 No-Shows and Charges. </strong>Late cancellations and no-shows may be charged the session fee. The Provider will notify the Client of any applicable charge and provide an invoice if applicable.</p>

						<h2>6. Confidentiality and Mandatory Exceptions</h2>
						<p><strong>6.1 Confidentiality. </strong>The Provider will keep the Client communications confidential and will not disclose them except: (a) with the Client's prior written consent; (b) when required by law (e.g., court order, subpoena); (c) to prevent imminent risk of serious physical harm to the Client or others; (d) when there are reasonable grounds to suspect abuse of a minor, elder, or vulnerable person; or (e) to third-party processors who are bound by confidentiality obligations.</p>
						<p><strong>6.2 Recordkeeping. </strong>The Provider may keep brief session notes for business, continuity of care, and legal compliance. The Client may request access to these records as described in Section 7.</p>

						<h2>7. Data Protection & Privacy - Key Notices</h2>
						<p><strong>Summary: </strong>The Provider collects Personal Data to deliver Services, manage bookings/payments, and improve Services. The Clients have rights under applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, UK Data Protection Act, CCPA/CPRA).</p>
						<p><strong>7.1 Controller. </strong>Redemption Era is the data controller for Personal Data processed in connection with the Services. <address>Contact: <a href="mailto:redemp.era2025@gmail.com">redemp.era2025@gmail.com</a></address></p>
						<p><strong>7.2 Purposes & Legal Bases. </strong>The Provider processes Personal Data to perform the contract (to deliver Services), for legitimate business purposes (administration, recordkeeping), and, where applicable, based on the Client consent. For EU/UK data subjects, the legal bases include contract performance and consent where required.</p>
						<p><strong>7.3 Data Subject Rights. </strong>The Clients may request access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, or object to processing where lawful. California residents may submit verifiable requests in accordance with applicable law.</p>
						<p><strong>7.4 Third-Party Platforms & Transfers. </strong>Sessions may occur on third-party platforms. The Provider uses processors under written agreements. For transfers of EU/EEA personal data outside the EEA, the Provider will rely on adequacy decisions, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), or other lawful transfer mechanisms as applicable. The Clients consent to use of such platforms.</p>
						<p><strong>7.5 Retention. </strong>Personal Data is retained only as necessary for contract performance, legal compliance, or legitimate business purposes.</p>
						<p><strong>7.6 Data Security. </strong>The Provider maintains technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data, but cannot guarantee absolute security of third-party platforms. The Clients should review third-party providers' privacy/security policies.</p>
						<p><strong>7.7 Minors. </strong>The Provider does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18 without written consent from a parent or legal guardian. If the Provider learns it has done so, the Provider will take steps to delete the data.</p>

						<h2>8. Package Expiration</h2>
						<p><strong>8.1 Validity Window. </strong>Each package indicates its validity window at purchase. Unused sessions expire at the end of that window and are forfeited, except where local law requires otherwise or the Provider agrees in writing to an extension.</p>
						<p><strong>8.2 Extensions. </strong>Extensions may be granted at the Provider's discretion and must be requested in writing before the package expires.</p>
						
						<h2>9. Electronic Signatures & Consent to Electronic Contracting</h2>
						<p><strong>9.1 Electronic Acceptance. </strong>The Client consents that electronic signatures, initials, checkboxes, and other electronic acts constitute a valid signature under applicable laws (e.g., ESIGN Act, eIDAS) and that such acts bind the Client to these Terms.</p>
						<p><strong>9.2 Recordkeeping. </strong>The Provider will retain a record of electronic acceptance, including the version of the Terms accepted, timestamp, and any associated metadata.</p>
						<p><strong>9.3 Checkout Consent for Immediate Performance (EU/UK Clients) </strong>Where a statutory withdrawal/cooling-off period may apply, the Provider will present a separate, unticked checkbox for the Client to consent to immediate performance and acknowledge that they will lose their statutory right to withdraw for Services already performed. The Provider will retain a record of that consent.</p>

						<h2>10. Use of Third-Party Payment & Communications Providers</h2>
						<p><strong>10.1 Payment Processors. </strong>Payments are processed by third parties (e.g., PayPal). The Provider is not responsible for third-party security practices. The Clients should review those providers' policies.</p>
						<p><strong>10.2 Service Interruptions. </strong>The Provider is not liable for Service interruptions caused by third-party platform outages.</p>
						<p><strong>10.3 No Liability for Third-Party Policies. </strong>The Provider does not control and is not responsible for third-party terms, privacy, or security practices.</p>

						<h2>11. Intellectual Property & Coaching Materials</h2>
						<p><strong>11.1 Ownership. </strong>The Provider retains all intellectual property rights in materials, exercises, and proprietary content delivered to the Client.</p>
						<p><strong>11.2 Limited License. </strong>The Provider grants the Client a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use materials for personal use only. Unauthorized copying, distribution, or publication is prohibited.</p>

						<h2>12. Limitation of Liability & Indemnity</h2>
						<p><strong>12.1 Limitation of Liability. </strong>To the maximum extent permitted by law, The Provider's total liability for claims arising from or relating to these Terms or the Services will not exceed the total fees paid by the Client to the Provider in the 12 months preceding the claim. This limitation does not apply to liability that cannot be limited by law (e.g., death or personal injury caused by gross negligence where such limitation is prohibited).</p>
						<p><strong>12.2 No Guarantee. </strong>The Provider does not guarantee specific results from coaching.</p>
						<p><strong>12.3 Indemnity. </strong>The Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless The Provider from third-party claims arising from the Client's breach of these Terms or unlawful acts.</p>

						<h2>13. Termination</h2>
						<p><strong>13.1 Termination for Convenience. </strong>Either party may terminate these Terms by written notice. If the Client terminates without cause, fees for sessions already performed are due. Pre-paid unused sessions will be handled per Section 8.</p>
						<p><strong>13.2 Termination for Cause. </strong>The Provider may terminate immediately for cause (e.g., abusive behavior, violation of these Terms, non-payment).</p>

						<h2>14. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
						<p><strong>14.1 Governing Law. </strong>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
						<p><strong>14.2 Dispute Resolution. </strong>Parties will attempt to resolve disputes informally. If unresolved, disputes may be resolved in either: (a) the courts of Camden County, New Jersey, United States of America, or (b) by binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), as selected in writing by The Provider. (The Provider recommends consulting local counsel to choose the appropriate dispute-resolution method. Arbitration and class-action waivers may be treated differently in various jurisdictions.)</p>

						<h2>15. Force Majeure</h2>
						<p>Neither party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond reasonable control (e.g., acts of God, pandemics, government actions, internet outages), provided the affected party promptly notifies the other and takes reasonable steps to mitigate.</p>
						
						<h2>16. Modification, Entire Agreement & Severability</h2>
						<p><strong>16.1 Modification. </strong>The Provider may update these Terms for future purchases. Changes will not affect packages already paid for unless agreed in writing. Where notice is required by law, the Provider will provide reasonable advance notice.</p>
						<p><strong>16.2 Entire Agreement. </strong>These Terms of Service and any package confirmation constitute the entire agreement between the Client and the Provider regarding Services.</p>
						<p><strong>16.3 Severability. </strong>If any provision is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the remaining provisions remain in effect.</p>

						<h2>17. Contact & Complaints</h2>
